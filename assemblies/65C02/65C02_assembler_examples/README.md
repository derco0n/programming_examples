# 65C02_assembler_examples
These programs are intended to run on a 65C02 microprocessor based breadboard-computer.
This is based on the work of Ben eater (https://eater.net/6502) and its great video series.

You may need an assembler like vasm (http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/index.php?view=main) to assemble the source to binary-files.

example: vasm6502_oldstyle -Fbin -dotdir ./source.s -o ./out.bin


## To Ben Eater
if you should ever discover this:
A big THANK YOU. Your videos are very informative and helped me a lot to understand how computers work on a very bare level.
I wish that teachers in school had been more like you.
